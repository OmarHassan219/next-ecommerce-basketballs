# Description

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Built a small ecommerce website to buy some Wilson Basketballs that allows the user to choose
between different basketballs and add it to the cart and head to the checkout .

The idea is to practice nextJS and try to use CMS (Content Management System) which is Sanity to fetch the basketballs and their information including name,price,side images and more. In addition, there is an option for a complete payment process using Stripe API.
